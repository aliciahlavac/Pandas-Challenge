# Pandas-Challenge
Module 4 Challenge
This challenge includes a Jupyter Notebook file, PyCitySchools.ipynb, which takes student and school data, and creates various DataFrames to analyze the data.  Included in the analysis was a high-level district summary, where the overall district was observed to see how students were performing in math and reading, as well as overall.  Next, school-level data was summarized, looking at each of the 15 schools in the district and how each one was performing, and grade-level was examined to see if there were differences between 9th-12th graders in the district.  Then, performance was looked at based on spending per student, and charter and district schools were examined. 

From this data, we can see that there are differences in the passing rates of students both between charter and district schools, as well as those schools that spend varying amounts of money per student.  One observable trend is that, on average, charter schools scored higher on both reading and math exams, and had a higher overall passing rate. For example, charter schools had an overall passing percentage of 90.4%, while district schools had an overall passing percentage of 53.67%.  Another observable trend is that as spending increased per student, the percent of students overall passing decreased.  For the percent overall passing, when less than 585 dollars were spent per student, 90.3% of students passed both math and reading.  When spending per student was increased to 585 to 630 dollars, the percent overall passing scores dropped to 81.4%.  When spending per student was further increased to 630 to 645 dollars, overall passing percentage dropped to 62.86%.  This overall passing percentage decreased again to 53.5% when spending per student increased to 645 to 680 dollars.

In order to run this Jupyter Notebook, there must be a Resources file containing schools_complete.csv and students_complete.csv.  Two observable trends are included in the beginning of PyCitySchools.ipynb.

I used code provided by an Ask BCS tutoring session for the school_types variable.  It is noted in the Jupyter Notebook file.
