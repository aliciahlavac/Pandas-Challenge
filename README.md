# Pandas-Challenge
Module 4 Challenge
This challenge includes a Jupyter Notebook file, PyCitySchools.ipynb, which takes student and school data, and creates various DataFrames to analyze the data.  Included in the analysis was a high-level district summary, where the overall district was observed to see how students were performing in math and reading, as well as overall.  Next, school-level data was summarized, looking at each of the 15 schools in the district and how each one was performing, and grade-level was examined to see if there were differences between 9th-12th graders in the district.  Then, performance was looked at based on spending per student, and charter and district schools were examined. 

In order to run this Jupyter Notebook, there must be a Resources file containing schools_complete.csv and students_complete.csv.
